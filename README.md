Ansible-Playground
==================

This repository constitutes of my endeavours using Ansible.
I wrote down a few more initial steps that are to be taken care of before
one starts using Ansible.

gdeploy
=======
It also constitutes of the gdeploy configuration files that am using to
test gdeploy modules/features.
Gdeploy is a tool to set-up and deploy GlusterFS using ansible over multiple hosts.
gdeploy is written to be modular, it can be used to deploy any software depending
on how the configuration file is written.
